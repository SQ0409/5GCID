# 5GCID：Data Set of 5GC Intrusion Detection System
# I. Dataset Introduction

The **5GCID (5GC Intrusion Detection System Data Set)** is specifically constructed for the research of **5G Core Network (5GC)** intrusion detection systems. With the widespread application of 5G networks, the 5GC faces numerous security threats. Existing deep-learning (DL)-based intrusion detection methods are restricted by the lack of suitable datasets. This dataset integrates data related to security vulnerabilities in the **Radio Access Network (RAN)** domain and the **5GC user domain**, providing strong support for 5GC intrusion detection research.

#  II. Dataset Content

## 🔐 (I) Threat Case Data

### 🛑 AMF DoS Attack Data

- Targets the **Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)** in the 5GC control plane.
- Simulates untrusted **Base Stations (gNBs)** forging large numbers of **User Equipment (UE)** registration requests to exhaust AMF resources.
- Includes:
  - SCTP/IP-level information: IP addresses, ports, packet and byte counts.
  - Signal data related to registration and authentication.

### 🛑 UPF DoS Attack Data

- Targets the **User Plane Function (UPF)** in the 5GC user plane.
- Attackers flood the UPF with illegal traffic.
- Involves:
  - **GTP-U** and **UDP** protocols.
  - Traffic features: network throughput, packet size, transmission duration.

### 🛑 SMF DoS Attack Data

- Targets the **Session Management Function (SMF)**, affecting both user and control planes.
- Malicious traffic is forwarded to SMF through UPF.
- Protocols used: **GTP-U**, **UDP**, and **HTTP**.
- Rich in traffic feature information.

## ✅ (II) Normal Case Data

A normal dataset corresponding to the **Ng interface** of the above threat cases is provided. It is designed for **comparative analysis**, helping researchers better identify abnormal traffic.

#  III. Dataset Construction Method

The data was collected using a **5G network security experimental platform** that complies with **3GPP specifications**.

Tools were designed and developed to simulate malicious traffic in the **RAN** and **5GC semi-trusted domains**:

- The source code of a simulated **UE** was modified to produce an **AMF DoS** attack tool.
- **Bonesi** and **HULK** tools were used to generate **UPF DoS** and **SMF DoS** attack traffic.

> The **5GCID dataset** was generated by executing these tools on the experimental platform and organizing the resulting data.

#  IV. Precautions

- This dataset is **only for academic research** and **5G network security technology development**. 🚫 It is **prohibited** from being used for any **illegal purposes**.

- When using the dataset, relevant **laws**, **regulations**, and **ethical norms** should be followed to protect **data privacy and security**.

- Due to the continuous development of **5G network technology**, the dataset may have **limitations**.  It is necessary to **analyze and adjust** according to the **actual situation** when using it.
